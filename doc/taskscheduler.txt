= Constants
=== VERSION
   Returns the current version number for this package as a string.
   
= Class Methods
=== TaskScheduler.new(task_name=nil, trigger=nil)
   Returns a new TaskScheduler object.  If the task name and trigger are
   passed as arguments, then a new work item is created and associated with
   that trigger, although you can still activate other tasks with the same
   object.
   
   Passing arguments to the constructor is effectively a shortcut for
   TaskScheduler.new plus TaskScheduler#new_work_item.
   
= Instance Methods
=== TaskScheduler#account_information
   Returns the account name associated with the task (but not the password).
   
=== TaskScheduler#add_trigger(index, trigger)
   Adds the given trigger at the specified index.
   
=== TaskScheduler#activate(job_name)
   Activates the given +job_name+.

=== TaskScheduler#application_name
   Returns the application associated with the task, i.e. the program that's
   to run at the specified date and time.
   
=== TaskScheduler#application_name=(name)
   Sets the application associated with the task, i.e. the application
   that runs at the specified date and time.
   
=== TaskScheduler#comment
   Returns the comment associated with the task.
   
=== TaskScheduler#comment=
   Sets the comment associated with the task.
   
=== TaskScheduler#creator
   Returns the name of the user who created the task.
   
=== TaskScheduler#creator=(name)
   Sets the name of the user who created the task.
   
=== TaskScheduler#delete(task_name)
   Deletes the task with the specified name.
   
=== TaskScheduler#delete_trigger(index)
   Deletes the trigger at the specified index.
   
=== TaskScheduler#enum
   Returns an array of task names.
   
=== TaskScheduler#exit_code
   Returns the exit code of from the task scheduler when it last attempted
   to run the task.
   
=== TaskScheduler#flags
   Returns a list of flags that modify the behavior of the work item.

=== TaskScheduler#flags=(flags)
   Sets a list of flags that modify the behavior of the work item.  See the
   'Task Flags' below for a list of valid flags.

=== TaskScheduler#machine=(host)
   Sets the active host.  If this is not set, then it is assumed you are
   working on the local host.
   
=== TaskScheduler#max_run_time
   Returns the maximum length of time, in milliseconds, the task can run
   before terminating.

=== TaskScheduler#max_run_time=(milliseconds)
   Sets the maximum length of time, in milliseconds, the task can run
   before terminating.

=== TaskScheduler#most_recent_run_time
   Returns a Time object indicating the most recent time the task ran.
   Returns nil if the task has never run.

=== TaskScheduler#new_work_item(task_name, trigger)
   Creates a new task with the associated trigger.  Note that the application
   name hasn't been set, nor has it been saved.

=== TaskSchedule#next_run_time
   Returns a Time object indicating the next time the task will run.

=== TaskScheduler#parameters
   Returns the parameters that are passed to the scheduled command.

=== TaskScheduler#parameters=(params)
   Sets the parameters that are passed to the scheduled command.

=== TaskScheduler#priority
   Returns the priority level for the active task (Fixnum).

=== TaskScheduler#priority=(level)
   Sets the priority level for the active task. The priority of a task
   determines the frequency and length of the time slices for a process.

   See the 'Priority Levels' constants for a list of valid priorities.

=== TaskScheduler#run
   Executes the currently active task.
 
=== TaskScheduler#save
   Saves the current task. It also releases all information relative to tasks.
   In order to modify this task again you must call Activate() because there
   is no active task now.

=== TaskScheduler#set_account_information(account_name, password)
   Sets the account name and password used to run the task.

=== TaskScheduler#status
   Returns the status of the current task.  The possible return values are
   "ready", "running", "not scheduled" or "unknown", though the latter should
   never occur.
 
   In the case of "not scheduled", it means that one or more of the
   properties that are needed to run the work item on a schedule
   have not been set.

=== TaskScheduler#terminate
   Terminatest the execution of the active task.

=== TaskScheduler#trigger(index)
   Returns a hash that describes the trigger for the active task at the
   given index.

=== TaskScheduler#trigger=(trigger_hash){
   Takes a hash that sets the various trigger values, i.e. when and how often
   the task will run.  Valid keys are:

   * start_year      # Must be >= current year
   * start_month     # 1-12
   * start_day       # 1-31
   * start_hour      # 0-23
   * start_minute    # 0-59
   * end_year
   * end_month
   * end_day
   * minutes_duration
   * minutes_interval
   * random_minutes_interval
   * flags
   * trigger_type
   * type            # A sub-hash

   The +trigger_type+ determines what values are valid for the
   +type+ key.  They are as follows:

   Trigger Type      Valid +type+ keys
   ============      ========================
   DAILY             days_interval
   WEEKLY            weeks_interval, days_of_week
   MONTHLY_DATE      months, days
   MONTHLY_DOW       weeks, days_of_week, months
   
=== TaskScheduler#trigger_count
   Returns the number of triggers associated with the active task.

=== TaskScheduler#trigger_string
   Returns a string that describes the current trigger for the active task.      

=== TaskScheduler#working_directory
   Returns the current working directory for the active task.

=== TaskScheduler#working_directory=(dir)
   Sets the working directory for the scheduled command.

== Task Flags
=== INTERACTIVE
   This flag is used when converting Windows NT AT service jobs into work
   items. The Windows NT AT service job refers to At.exe, the Windows NT
   command-line utility used for creating jobs for the Windows NT Schedule
   service. The Task Scheduler service replaces the Schedule service and is
   backwards compatible with it. The conversion occurs when the Task
   Scheduler is installed on Windows NT/Windows 2000 for example, if you
   install Internet Explorer 4.0, or upgrade to Windows 2000. During the
   setup process, the Task Scheduler installation code searches the registry
   for jobs created for the AT service and creates work items that will
   accomplish the same operation.

   For such converted jobs, the interactive flag is set if the work item is
   intended to be displayed to the user. When this flag is not set, no work
   items are displayed in the Tasks folder, and no user interface associated
   with the work item is presented to the user when the work item is
   executed.
   
=== DELETE_WHEN_DONE
   The work item will be deleted when there are no more scheduled run times.
   
=== DISABLED
   The work item is disabled. This is useful to temporarily prevent a work
   item from running at the scheduled time(s).
   
=== HIDDEN
   The work item created will be hidden.

=== RUN_ONLY_IF_LOGGED_ON
   The work item runs only if the user specified in +set_account_information+
   is logged on interactively. This flag has no effect on work items set to
   run in the local account.
   
=== START_ONLY_IF_IDLE
    The work item begins only if the computer is not in use at the scheduled
    start time.
    
=== SYSTEM_REQUIRED
    The work item causes the system to be resumed, or awakened, if the system
    is running on battery power. This flag is supported only on systems that
    support resume timers.
    
=== KILL_ON_IDLE_END
    The work item terminates if the computer makes an idle to non-idle
    transition while the work item is running. The computer is not
    considered idle until the IdleWait triggers' time elapses with no user
    input.
    
=== RESTART_ON_IDLE_RESUME
    The work item starts again if the computer makes a non-idle to idle
    transition before all the work item's task triggers elapse.
    (Use this flag in conjunction with KILL_ON_IDLE_END.)
    
=== DONT_START_IF_ON_BATTERIES
    The work item does not start if its target computer is running on
    battery power.
    
=== KILL_IF_GOING_ON_BATTERIES
    The work item ends, and the associated application quits if the work
    item's target computer switches to battery power.

= Notes
   The terms "work item" and "task" are effectively synonymous for purposes
   of this documentation.
   
= Known Bugs
   The 'account_information()' method appears to be busted.

   Please log all bug reports on the project page at
   http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils
   
= Future Plans
   Add support for Windows Vista and later.
   Add support for IDLE, SYSTEMSTART and LOGON.
