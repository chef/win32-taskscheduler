  * win32-api
  * windows-pr

  gem install win32-taskscheduler

= Synopsis
  require 'win32/taskscheduler'
  include Win32

  # Create a trigger that starts on April 25, 2014 at 11:05 pm. The trigger
  # will run on the first and last week of the month, on Monday and Friday,
  # in the months of April and May.
  #
  trigger = {
    :start_year   => 2014,
    :start_month  => 4,
    :start_day    => 25,
    :start_hour   => 23,
    :start_minute => 5,
    :trigger_type => TaskScheduler::MONTHLYDOW,
    :type => {
      :weeks        => TaskScheduler::FIRST_WEEK | TaskScheduler::LAST_WEEK,
      :days_of_week => TaskScheduler::MONDAY | TaskScheduler::FRIDAY,
      :months       => TaskScheduler::APRIL | TaskScheduler::MAY
    }
  }

  ts.new_work_item('my_notepad', trigger)
  ts.application_name = 'notepad.exe'
  ts.save
